# Social Media Webapp

This project was built following Corey Schafer's 17 part series on Python and Django (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p&ab_channel=CoreySchafer). This project introduced me to several important topics, such as writing HTML, CSS, and taught me how to work inside of the Django framework. During this process, I also learned how to deploy a website on a server and protect the server using SSH key based authetication.
